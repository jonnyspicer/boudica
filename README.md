# Boudica

This is the beginnings of a chess engine implemented in Go. I am a mediocre chess player and a mediocre programmer, so I have very low expectations for it. My main motivation behind
the project is to improve my knowledge of Golang and try to learn how to write high-quality, performant, idiomatic code. If I make something cool in the process, that's a huge bonus.

## Todo

- Initialise standard starting position
- standard pawn move generation
- en passant move generation
- sliding piece move generation
- knight move generation
- castling move generation
- implement Perft
- output UCI
- search
- eval

If you're interested in chess programming, the [chess programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page)
is invaluable. It is my primary source of information for writing this engine, and all the techniques I've implemented
are described on the wiki.
