#Boudica

This is the beginnings of a chess engine implemented in C# - it is very, very much a work in progress.

## Todo
- ~~Initialise standard starting position~~
- ~~standard pawn move generation~~
- en passant move generation (in progress, currently bugged)
- sliding piece move generation
- knight move generation
- castling move generation
- implement Perft
- output UCI
- search
- eval
- frontend

If you're interested in chess programming, the [chess programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
is invaluable. It is my primary source of information for writing this engine, and all the techniques I've implemented
are described on the wiki.
